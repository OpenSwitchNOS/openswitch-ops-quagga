## BGP ##
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is most commonly used **inter-AS** (autonomous system) routing protocol. The latest BGP version is 4. **BGP-4** supports Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) i.e. advertises the routes based on destinations as an IP prefix and not the network "class" within BGP.
## Overview ##
BGP is **path-vector** protocol which provides routing information across various BGP routers to be exchanged using destination-based forwarding i.e. router sends packets based merely on destination IP address carried in the IP header of the packet. In most cases, we have multiple routes to the same destination then BGP decides which route to choose using path attributes, for e.g. *"Shortest AS_Path"*, *"Multi_Exit_Disc (Multi-exit discriminator, or MED)"*,*"Origin"*, *Next_hop*, *Local_pref*, etc.
## How to use the feature ##

BGP provides routing for routers/switches that can be deployed in ISP, Enterprise and data centers.

## Setting up the basic configuration ##
Following is the minimum configuration needed to setup the BGP router. AS number is unique to the Autonomous system and is used to distinguish between internal/external BGP connections.

> router bgp < asn >

Enable **BGP router** for given AS number. AS numbers ranges from 1-65535.

> 	bgp router-id A.B.C.D

Sets **BGP router-ID** to A.B.C.D.

> no bgp router-id  A.B.C.D

Defaults BGP router-ID to **0.0.0.0**.

> 	no router bgp < asn >

Disable the BGP process with given AS number.

## Setting up the optional configuration ##
**BGP Router**

> maximum-paths < paths >

Limits the maximum number of paths for BGP. If global ECMP is enabled and BGP maximum-paths is set greater than global maximum-paths, then, global overrides BGP maximum-paths. If global ECMP is disabled then only single best path gets selected.
>no  maximum-paths

Defaults maximum-paths as "1".

> timers bgp < keepalive > < holdtime >

Sets the keep-alive and hold-time timers for BGP router.

>no timers bgp < keepalive > < holdtime >

Defaults the keep-alive interval to 180 seconds and hold-time timer to 60 seconds for BGP router.
Note: All BGP commands should be executed under **"router bgp < asn >"** context.

**BGP Network**

BGP network adds a static network to BGP routing table.

> network A.B.C.D/M

Announces the specified network to all peers in the AS.

> no network A.B.C.D/M

Removes the announced network for this BGP router.

**BGP Peer**

Following  are the neighbor configuration commands.

> neighbor peer remote-as asn

Defines a new peer with remote-as as *asn*. *peer* is IPv4 address. If remote-as is not configured, *bgpd* throws an error as *"canâ€™t find neighbor peer"*.

>no neighbor peer remote-as asn

Deletes the peer.
> neighbor peer description < some_description >

Sets the description for BGP peer.

>no  neighbor peer description < some_description >

Deletes the neighbor description info.
> neighbor peer password < some_password >

Enables MD5 authentication on TCP connection between BGP peers.
> no neighbor peer password < some_password >

Disables MD5 authentication on TCP connection between BGP peers.

> neighbor peer timers < keepalive > < holdtimer >

Sets the keep-alive and hold-time for a specific BGP peer.

> no neighbor peer timers < keepalive > < holdtimer >

Clears the keep-alive and hold-time for a specific BGP peer.

> neighbor peer allowas-in < ASN_instances_allowed >

Specifies the number of times BGP allows an instance of AS to be in the AS_PATH.

> no neighbor peer allowas-in < ASN_instances_allowed >

Removes the number of times BGP allows an instance of AS to be in the AS_PATH. Range is 1-10.

> neighbor peer remove-private-AS

Removes private AS numbers from the AS path in outbound routing updates.

> no neighbor peer remove-private-AS

Allows the private AS numbers from the AS path in outbound routing updates.

> neighbor peer soft-reconfiguration inbound

Enables software-based reconfiguration to generate inbound updates from a neighbor without clearing the BGP session.

**BGP Peer-Group**

Peer-group is a collection of peers which shares same outbound policy. Neighbors belonging to the same peer-group might have different inbound policies.
> neighbor *word* peer-group

Defines a new peer-group. *word* is name of the peer-group.

> neighbor peer peer-group word

Binds a specific peer to the peer-group provided.

Note: All peer commands are applicable to peer-group as well.

**Peer filtering**

 - **Route Map**

	>  route-map *word* (deny|permit) < sequence_num >

	Configures a route map for given sequence number. *word* is route_map name. *sequence_num* ranges  between 1-65535.

	> neighbor peer route-map *word* in|out

	Assigns the route map to the peer for given direction.

	> description < some_route_map_description >

	Allows to add route map description.

	> set community .AA:NN additive

	Assigns or changes community for route map.

	>  set metric <0-4294967295>

	Sets/changes metric for route map.

 - **IP Prefix List**

	> ip prefix-list *word* seq <1-4294967295> (deny|permit) (A.B.C.D/M|any)

	Configures the ip prefix-list for given route map.

	>  match ip address prefix-list *word*

	Configure route map for match on given IP_address.

## Verifying the configuration ##
Verification of configuration can be done using **"show running-config".** All active configs should be available in the show running-config. Please see the sample output below:

> s1# show running-config

## Troubleshooting the configuration ##

Following are the commands to verify the BGP route related information.
**"show ip bgp"** verifies if all routes are been advertised from peers.
> **s2# show ip bgp**
Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, > best, = multipath,
              i internal, S Stale, R Removed
Origin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete
Local router-id 9.0.0.2
   Network           Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path
*> 11.0.0.0/8       9.0.0.1                  0      0      0 1 i

To get the more information about a specific peer, use below show command.

> **s2# show ip bgp 11.0.0.0/8**
BGP routing table entry for 11.0.0.0/8
Paths: (1 available, best #1)
AS: 1

      Last update: Thu Sep 24 22:45:52 2015

Peer status can be verified using "show ip bgp summary" command. Along with peer status, additional neighbor information such as BGP packet statistics, total RIB entries, bgp router-id, local AS number gets logged in this command.
>**s2# show ip bgp summary**

"show ip bgp neighbors" provides detailed information about neighbor, for e.g. neighbor state, description, tcp port number, password (if any), statistics.
